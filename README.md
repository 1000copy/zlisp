# ZLisp 0.1

Wow, ZLisp is a LISP interpreter consisting of approximately 300 lines of code, written in the Zig programming language.

## Why choose to implement LISP?

This is because LISP has an extremely concise syntax while also offering very flexible and powerful expressive capabilities.

## Why choose to implement it in Zig?

I previously implemented a LISP interpreter in the C language. Now, I want to learn the Zig language and take the opportunity to compare the characteristics of the two languages. My conclusion is that Zig is a better alternative to C.

## Current implementation progress?

Parsed the basic syntax of LISP language
Implemented 4 LISP primitives, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

## What features are planned for the future?

Support for more syntax, including strings, annotations, and references
Support for more LISP primitives, including append, begin, car, cdr, cons, =, length, list, not, print, define, setq, repeat, load, eval

## ZLisp Zen

I adhere to the philosophy of a straightforward implementation without any unnecessary techniques.
